# Learning Git/Github from Daniel Shiffman

## Introduction

My favourite & only version control system has been - for a long time - [RCS](, 'Revision Control System') - created, I believe, as far back as 1982.  And although it is said to be relatively simple to use, for me it was best explained - to the modest level I wanted to use it - by Carla Schroder in her book: "Linux Cookbook". It was fine for me as a lone user not needing to collaberate with anyone in a way that might have led me to CVS or Subversion, etc.  Perhaps I still don't neeed to change but I have now come to love things like the RStudio IDE and the Atom editor and these products encourage linking into Git/Github. I have been a little apprehensive to make the move. But I stumbled across some Daniel Shiffman video tutorials for beginners.  This guy is the greatest teacher of *anything* I have ever seen! So what have I got to lose?!

## Shiffman - Tutorial 1  
(see reference 2 below)  
For real beginners - just what I like!
Some terminology:  
- Git - the version control software (useable both online & offline)
- Github the website that provides the Git services online
- Repository ('Repo')  a collection of files - as with a project
- commit - like doing a *save*  
  - commit hash  
  
1. Put a file (eg a text file) - maybe a poem! - into a Repo:  
  - click new repo  
  - name the file  
  - give it a description  
  - make it *public*  
  - tick in box to ititialise the repo with a *readme* file
  - click 'create the repo'  

2. click *new file* to add
  - name it
  - click *commit new file (to master branch)  
  
3. edit the file to make a change
  - click the edit button (disguised as a pen)
